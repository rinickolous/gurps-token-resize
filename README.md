# GURPS Token Resizer
This is a tool for [NaN's GGA](https://github.com/crnormand/gurps), allowing you to resize tokens beyond Foundry's normal,
and automatically calculating an appropriate size for the token, based on the included Hex Base templates.

## Use Instructions:
- Add the contents of [`script.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rinickolous/gurps-token-resize/main/script.js) as a FoundryVTT Macro (making sure "script" is selected under "Type").
- Select an actor (by clicking on a token, or a character sheet).
- Execute the macro. When prompted, enter the length of the token (a whole number, equal to the length in hexes of the longest size of the token). Press Enter.
- The token should now be appropriately resized.

This repository includes templates for tokens of various sizes found in GURPS sourcebooks. These are intended to be used with the script.
To use these, simply overlay your desired actor token over the template in any image editing software of your choice.
